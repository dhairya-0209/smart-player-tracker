# ‚öΩ Smart Player Tracker üß†üéØ
Player re-identification using YOLOv11 and Deep SORT

---

## üöÄ Project Summary

This project is built to **detect, identify, and track players and referees** in a football match using a pre-trained YOLOv8 model combined with Deep SORT tracking. It processes video input frame-by-frame, draws bounding boxes, and assigns consistent IDs to each individual ‚Äî all saved into a resulting video.

This wasn't just a project, it was a **marathon of determination, learning, debugging, and never giving up**. From 12 PM to 12 AM, this tracker was brought to life with sheer passion.
